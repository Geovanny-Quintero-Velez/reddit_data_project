1kjo6uj,What are your ETL data cleaning/standardisation rules?,"As the title says. 

We're in the process of rearchitecting our ETL pipeline design (for a multitude of reasons), and we want a step after ingestion and contract validation where we perform a light level of standardisation so data is more consistent and reusable. For context, we're a low data maturity organisation and there is little-to-no DQ governance over applications, so it's on us to ensure the data we use is fit for use.

These are our current thinking on rules; what do y'all do out there for yours?

* UTF-8 and parquet
* ISO-8601 datetime format
* NFC string normalisation (one of our country's languages uses macrons)
* Remove control characters - Unicode category ""C""
* *Remove invalid UTF-8 characters?? e.g. str.encode/decode process*
* Trim leading/trailing whitespace

(Deduplication is currently being debated as to whether it's a contract violation or something we handle)",54,22,Nightwyrm,2025-05-11 00:13:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kjo6uj/what_are_your_etl_data_cleaningstandardisation/,0,False,False,False,False
1kjfl2n,What Platform Do You Use for Interviewing Candidates?,"It seems like basically every time I apply at a company, they have a different process. My company uses a mix of Hex notebooks we cobbled together and just asking the person questions. I am wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a seamless, one-stop platform for the entire interviewing process to test a candidate? A single platform where I can test them on DAGs (airflow / dbt), SQL, Python, system diagrams, etc and also save the feedback for each test.

1kk0xxg,Last 2 months I have been humbled by the data engineering landscape,"Hello All,

For the past 6 years I have been working in the data analyst and data engineer role (My title is Senior Data Analyst ). I have been working with Snowflake writing stored procedures, spark using databricks, ADF for orchestration, SQL server, power BI & Tableau dashboards. All the data processing has been either monthly or quarterly. I was always under the impression that I was going to be quite employable when I try to switch at some point.

But the past few months have taught me that there aren't many data analyst openings and the field doesn't pay squat and is mostly for freshers and the data engineering that I have been doing isn't really actual data engineering.

All the openings I see require knowledge of Kafka, docker, kubernetes, microservices, airflow, mlops, API integration, CI/CD etc. This has left me stunned at the very least. I never knew that most of the companies required such a diverse set of skills and data engineering was more of SWE rather than what I have been doing. Seriously not sure what to think of the scenario I am in.",31,20,skatez101,2025-05-11 13:23:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kk0xxg/last_2_months_i_have_been_humbled_by_the_data/,0,False,False,False,False

1kjjo2u,DBT full_refresh for Very Big Dataset in BigQuery,"How do we handle the initial load or backfills in BigQuery using DBT for a huge dataset?

Consider the sample configuration below:

{{ config(  
materialized='incremental',  
incremental\_strategy='insert\_overwrite',  
partition\_by={  
""field"": ""dt"",  
""data\_type"": ""date""  
},  
cluster\_by=\[""orgid""\]  
) }}  
  
FROM {{ source('wifi\_data', 'wifi\_15min') }}

{% if is\_incremental() %}  
AND DATE(connection\_time) > (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(dt), ""1990-01-01"") FROM {{ this }})  
{% endif %}

I will do some aggregations and lookup joins on the above dataset. Now, if the above source dataset (wifi\_15min) has 10B+ records per day and the expected number of partitions (DATE(connection\_time)) is 70 days, will BigQuery be able to handle 70Days\*10B=700B+ records in case of full\_refresh in a single go?

Or is there a better way to handle such scenarios in DBT?",14,8,Abhishek4996,2025-05-10 20:34:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kjjo2u/dbt_full_refresh_for_very_big_dataset_in_bigquery/,0,False,False,False,False

1kjsirz,10 Must-Know Queries to Observe Snowflake Performance â€” Part 1,"Hi all â€” I recently wrote a practical guide that walks through 10 SQL queries you can use to **observe Snowflake performance** before diving into any tuning or optimization.

The post includes queries to:

* Identify long-running and expensive queries
* Detect warehouse queuing and disk spillage
* Monitor cache misses and slow task execution
* Spot heavy data scans

These are the queries I personally find most helpful when trying to understand whatâ€™s *really* going on inside Snowflake â€” especially before looking at clustering or tuning pipelines.

1kjxab3,I built a database of WSL players' performance stats using data scraped from Fbref,"


On one hand, I needed the data as I wanted to analyse the performance of my favourite players in the Women Super League. On the other hand, I'd finished an Introduction To Databases course offered by CS50 and the final project was to build a database.

So killing both birds with one stone, I built the database using data starting from the 2021-22 season and until this current season (2024-25). 

I scrape and clean the data in notebooks, multiple notebooks as there are multiple tables focusing on different aspects of performance e.g. shooting, passing, defending, goalkeeping, pass types etc.

I then create relationships across the tables and then load them into a database I created in Google's BigQuery. 

At first I collected and only used data from previous seasons to set up the database, before updating it with this current season's data. As the current season hasn't ended (actually ended last Saturday), I wanted to be able to handle more recent updates by just rerunning the notebooks without affecting other season's data. That's why the current season is handled in a different folder, and newer seasons will have their own folders too.

I'm a beginner in terms of databases and the methods I use reflect my current understanding.



TLDR: I built a database of Women Super League players using data scraped from Fbref. The data starts from the 2021-22 till this current season.

2) Read incremental data on a daily basis from salesforce using api (to query 100000 records per batch)

3) perform data transformations using data quality rules

4) saving final data by implementing data merging using upserts to redshift table

5) Handling logs to handle exceptions which arise during processing.

1kjuwnl,Do People Actually Code as They Climb the Career Ladder?,"Do People Actually Code as They Climb the Career Ladder?

When I first started my career in tech more than a decade ago, I had this naive assumption that coding was something you did forever, no matter where you were on the career ladder.

But as Iâ€™ve climbed higher up the ladder, Iâ€™ve realized itâ€™s not quite that simple.

The truth is, your role evolves. And while coding remains a critical part of many tech careers, its prominence shifts depending on the level youâ€™re at. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned along the way --

ðŸ”¸In the beginning, coding is everything. Youâ€™re building your foundation - learning programming languages, frameworks, and debugging skills.
ðŸ”¸As you grow into mid-level roles, things start to change. Youâ€™re no longer just executing tasks but youâ€™re leading small teams, mentoring juniors, and contributing to architectural decisions. Your value isnâ€™t just in writing code but also in understanding *why* certain solutions are chosen over others.
ðŸ”¸By the time you reach senior or lead positions, your focus has likely shifted even further away from daily coding. Instead, youâ€™re setting technical direction, defining best practices, and ensuring alignment across teams. Yes, you might still dive into code occasionally, but itâ€™s usually to unblock critical issues or set an example.
ðŸ”¸If you move into management, or even executive roles, your relationship with coding will transform again. At this point, your primary responsibility is people and strategy. Writing code becomes rare, though having a strong technical background gives you credibility and insight into challenges your team faces.

Soâ€¦ Do People Actually Code As They Climb?

ðŸ”ºYes, but the amount and type of coding vary greatly depending on your role. For individual contributors (ICs), especially those aiming for principal engineer tracks, coding remains central. For managers or leaders, it becomes more about guiding strategy and enabling others to shine.

To anyone navigating this path, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts. How has your relationship with coding changed as youâ€™ve grown in your career?",0,8,arvindspeaks,2025-05-11 06:57:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kjuwnl/do_people_actually_code_as_they_climb_the_career/,0,False,False,False,False
